```
igniting the using parcel
cd "Igniting the app"

npx parcel index.html  (index.html --> source file)

npm --> used to install a package
npx -->  used to execute a package

another way to get react to our app is to use npm

cdn links are not the prefered way to use react why?
    fetehing from a cdn is a costly operation
    if i have a react module inside my app that will be so easy
     
     ``` 
     npm install react --> there is no -D , we need react as a normal dependency
     "dependencies": {
            "react": "^19.2.3"
        } --> is added to package.json


    npm install react-dom
    "dependencies": {
    "react": "^19.2.3",
    "react-dom": "^19.2.3"
  }

  now we no longer need the cdn - remove them

  now if you use React in your app error will be shown

  that's why we use :-
        import React from "react";
        import ReactDOM from "react";
    now we are using react from the node_modules that why we import them
!@#

there will be a error:- 🚨 @parcel/transformer-js: Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.
this error came because:
    ??
soln:
    Add the type="module" attribute to the <script> tag in your html 
    <script type="module" src="App.js"></script>




another error:
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react";


const headingElement = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  { id: "heading" },
  "Hello, React!",
);

console.log(headingElement);

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(headingElement);

TypeError: (0 , _reactDefault.default).createRoot is not a function


soln:
        import React from "react";
        mport ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

# what parcel is doing for you
- dev bulid
- local server
- HMR -> hot module replacement:
    how its doing that:
        parcel uses a File Watching Algorithm - written in c++
- by using caching - faster builds 
    where is cache stored:
        .parcel-cache in your project folder
- Image Optimisation
- if u create a production build :
    Minification of our files
    compress your file
- bundling
- Consistent Hashing --> read
- Code splitting
- Differential Bundling - support older Browser --> read
- Diagnoistic
- Error Handling
- it gives you a way to hoist in HTTPS
- Tree shaking Algorithm - remove unused code 
- different bundle for development and production

parcel.org --> read the docs
this will help you in system desing interview

# make a production build

``` 
        npx parcel build index.html 
        when you run this you will get an error 
        because in package.json 
        parcel conflicts with main : "App.js" but we give
        the entry point as index.html so just remove the 
        main : "App.js" from the package.json
